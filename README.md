# [/mjg/ Repository](https://repo.riichi.moe)

maajan repo for the maajan general. pls apply as repoanons, thanks. ~~No seriously, everybody is dead~~ there's people now, but help is still needed.

something wrong with repo? submit an issue. no github account? shitpost it in the thread, someone is bound to read it. nobody reads the feedback section, it was a prank.

if you want your own article, or fix/improve/delete things yourself, become part of the prestigious [/mjg/ organization](https://github.com/vg-mjg). only requirements are a github account, unconditional love for meido and a submitted essay on at least 10 intermediate/expert wwyds, your answers and your personal reasoning. Additional requirement to become org owner: ten games feeded to our wife akochan without her disagreeing. if unable to submit any of these, then your favorite loli doujin that will be reviewed by the committee will suffice.

[**/mjg/ Repo Constitution**](https://github.com/vg-mjg/mjg-repo/issues/95)

# Reorganization Plans
- Make a Guides section its own thing instead of being buried in the Library of Resources

# to do
- misc pages with lots of useful tools don't ask me yet what this means
- rb1 vn (for real this time) (check this at the vn folder) (which is now a branch of its own)
- akochan lewd dumps somewhere, if you click the lucky link, you get a random akochan being ronned by old men for points
- let me play tsukihime on the browser
- Core Majsoul Mods with only the essential mods in

\>noooo you have to put it in the issues\
these aren't issues these are DREAMS

Want your implement your own shit that nobody can deny? Hate github and shan't ever make an account? As usual just win a tourney/league/whatever and make the request, as stated in the repo constitution article 4 section 4.
