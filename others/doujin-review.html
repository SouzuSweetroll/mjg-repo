      <p>Holy fuck. Kumako's voice is too airy, cute and perfect. This is, for me at the very least, the pinnacle of cute music. Okay, hear me out. I'm a big fan of denpa music. In fact, my favorite singer tied to nao (I don't really like nao songs, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kujLgpwTA4g">this is my personal favorite song</a>) is Koko. Fuck, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wl8Ofce8TE">this album</a> is perfect. Nanahira songs are either a really good hit or a sad miss, but all koko songs no exception are good. I mean, listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAXgSMXo00">fucking</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tKiwiCKqg4">this</a>. Denpa artists are the best when it comes to cutesongs. But... with Kumako in this song, it's different. It's magic. There's no other way to explain it. It's a tragic mix of electro-bass beats and cuteness. Do I understand the song? Yes I do. It speaks to the SOUL despite being chinese, one of the most soulless language in the world. It's a sultry kind of cuteness, charming, calls you closer with her cute voice and you can just imagine sinking deeper into the cutevoid as the darkness fades into a cuter violet color. It's what I'd call a perfectly cute song. In fact, if I needed a meter to measure cuteness, this song would be the peak.</p>
      <p>It starts with a few catchy bass beats and electronic stuff to ease you in. Then, her voice hits. You hear it, that perfect blend of whisper, a cute pitch that doesn't feel grating to the ears, and that simplicity. Man, that simplicity of her voice. You know she isn't forcing the cuteness out. It's cute, plain and simple, and easy to understand. Long ago, I hated sexy shit because it emphasized womanly beauty and was a hindrance to the peak childish cuteness hiding behind, but this song unironically changed my entire philosophy on it. Sexiness has the power to amplify cuteness to a degree never seen before. This song is proof of it, and what more, it wouldn't work if you tried to remove the whispery voice and changed it to the generic cutepitch voice. It would be cute, yes, but it won't be as cute as this song.</p>
      <p>You might think I'm repeating myself, but all I'm really trying to do is, in my own limited way, try to convey just how perfect and cute this song is. How the fuck did this song even exist? It was the first time that my absolute philosophy of cuteness was shaken. I realized that despite the absoluteness of cuteness, the human mind had a limited capacity to understand it. This song will be the song that will open a new age of the understanding of cuteness, that is what I truly believe.</p>

      <h2>Week 1 - Bath-House Bonding With Mai-chan</h2>

    <p>There is an ART to oppai loli. You don't just draw a loli, make her boobs bigger, and call it a day. No. There is a specific science to it, and this artist just nails it. So the story is that this neighborhood friend of yours (who calls you onii-chan, important detail to note) has her bath being repaired, so she goes to the local bath-house. And what do you know, onii-chan is there too. And what do you know, the girl wants to bath with you.</p>
    <p>Alright, I know what you're going to say. Nooooooo, it's not oppai loli the girl doesn't even look like a loliiiii. And to you I say, yes, you're right, but still shut the fuck up. She's a fourth grader. What, it's more accurate to call her shortstack? Why don't you shortstack yourself in a fucking sack and if you don't think context is more important than the apparent design, you're a retarded pleb. For example, take that one doujin where the kindergarten kids turn into hags. And now you ask yourself: is it loli? And to which I reply: no. It's not loli. Why? 'Cause they're fucking hags. Is a 3000 year old vampire loli a true loli? Yes, sure. So how do you define it? Simple. Are they depicted as a loli? If so, then yes, it's a loli.</p>
    <p>I'm getting lost. So what I'm talking about, is that yes, this is a loli doujin. It's a great one with good sensible proportions, the girl is super cute, everything is cute and that's all that matters. Pure cute vanilla goodness. I definitely recommend reading this, and maybe check out the artist's other works because he also made that one top-tier doujin about also another oppai loli, but holy shit was that perfect.</p>
